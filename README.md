# census-hard-to-map-analysis

This data preparation routine was developed for the April 29, 2019, Los Angeles Times story ["A census undercount could cost California billions â€” and L.A. is famously hard to track"](https://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-la-county-census-hard-to-count-20190429-htmlstory.html).

It combines the California Department of Finance's "hard to count" estimates with the tract maps published by the U.S. Census Bureau. Together they were used to make a graphic to accompany the story.
